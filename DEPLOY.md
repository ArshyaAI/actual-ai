# 🚀 Easy Deployment Guide

## ✅ Fixed the Docker Issue

The package-lock.json error has been resolved. Here are 3 easy ways to deploy:

## Option 1: Railway (Recommended - No Docker)

1. **Run the deployment script:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-railway.sh
   ```
   
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   railway login
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

## Option 2: Vercel (Frontend + Serverless)

1. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel login
   vercel deploy
   ```

## Option 3: Railway with Docker (Fixed)

The Dockerfile has been simplified. Now you can use:
```bash
railway up
```

## ✅ What's Fixed:

- ✅ Created missing `frontend/package-lock.json`
- ✅ Simplified Dockerfile 
- ✅ Updated Railway config to not require Docker
- ✅ Created deployment script with your API key

## 🎯 Recommended: Use Railway without Docker

Run this command:
```bash
./deploy-railway.sh
```

Your Swiss Bookkeeping Agent will be live in minutes! 🇨🇭

## 🔍 Test Locally First (Optional)

```bash
# Test the API key (already works)
node test-claude.js

# Try building locally
npm run build
```

The deployment is now much simpler and should work without any Docker issues!
